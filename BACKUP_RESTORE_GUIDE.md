```

## 📋 Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before starting user lifecycle implementation:
- [x] Current app fully tested and working ✅
- [x] All changes committed to git ✅
- [x] Safe backup point created ✅
- [x] User requirements documented ✅
- [x] Implementation plan created ✅
- [ ] Database backup created (recommended)
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Dependencies list updated

## 🗃️ Database Backup Recommendation

```bash
# Create database backup (adjust path as needed)
python -c "
import sqlite3
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

# Create timestamped backup
timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
backup_name = f'database_backup_before_lifecycle_{timestamp}.db'
shutil.copy2('path/to/your/database.db', backup_name)
print(f'Database backup created: {backup_name}')
"
```
