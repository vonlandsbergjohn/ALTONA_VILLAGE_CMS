# 🐛 FUTURE RESIDENCY STATUS DROPDOWN FIX

## 🚨 Problem Identified:
The "Future Residency Status" dropdown was not accepting inputs due to **field conflicts**.

## 🔍 Root Cause:
1. **Duplicate field initialization**: `new_occupant_type: ''` appeared **twice** in formData state
2. **Conflicting Select components**: Two different Select components were controlling the same field:
   - **New field** (line 439): "Future Residency Status" with values `resident`, `owner`, `owner_resident`
   - **Old field** (line 525): "Expected New Occupant Type" with values `new_owner`, `new_tenant`, etc.

## ✅ Fix Applied:
1. **Removed duplicate field** from formData state initialization
2. **Removed conflicting Select component** (the old "Expected New Occupant Type")
3. **Added debugging** to handleInputChange function
4. **Kept the new improved field** with proper residency status values

## 🎯 Result:
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for new_occupant_type field
- ✅ **Clear dropdown options**: resident, owner, owner_resident
- ✅ **No field conflicts** between multiple Select components
- ✅ **Debugging enabled** to monitor field changes

## 🧪 Testing:
The "Future Residency Status" dropdown should now:
- ✅ **Accept selections** from the dropdown
- ✅ **Update form state** properly
- ✅ **Show selected value** in the field
- ✅ **Work with form submission** and validation

The servers are running - you can now test the form and the dropdown should work correctly!
