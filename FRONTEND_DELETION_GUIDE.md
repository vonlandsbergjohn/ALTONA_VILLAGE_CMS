# 🗑️ FRONTEND PERMANENT USER DELETION FEATURE

## 📍 **LOCATION IN ADMIN DASHBOARD**

The permanent user deletion feature has been integrated into the **Admin Residents** section of the dashboard:

## 🖱️ **HOW TO ACCESS**

1. **Login as Admin** to the Altona Village CMS

4. **Locate the user** you want to delete
5. **Look for the red trash icon** (🗑️) next to the Edit button on each user card

## 🔴 **DELETE BUTTON LOCATION**

Each user card now has **TWO action buttons**:
- 📝 **Edit Button** (Blue outline) - Opens user edit dialog
- 🗑️ **Delete Button** (Red) - Permanent deletion with warning

The delete button is a **red destructive button** with a trash icon that appears on every user card.

## 🛡️ **SAFETY CONFIRMATIONS**

When you click the delete button, the system requires **THREE confirmations**:

### 1️⃣ **First Warning Dialog**
```
⚠️ PERMANENT DELETION WARNING

This will permanently delete user@email.com and ALL their data including:
• User account
• Resident/Owner profiles  
• All vehicles
• All complaints
• All related records

This action CANNOT be undone!

Are you absolutely sure you want to continue?
```

### 2️⃣ **Confirmation Text Input**
```
To confirm this permanent deletion, type "DELETE" (case sensitive):
[text input field]
```
You must type exactly **"DELETE"** (uppercase) to proceed.

### 3️⃣ **Deletion Reason**
```
Please provide a reason for deleting user@email.com:

Examples:

```
A reason is **required** and will be logged for audit purposes.

## ✅ **SUCCESS CONFIRMATION**

The user will immediately disappear from the residents list.
