# Altona Village CMS - User Lifecycle Management Implementation Plan

**Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Based on:** Completed stakeholder discussion document  
**Status:** Ready for implementation

---

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on your detailed responses, here's what we'll implement:

### **Core Principles:**
- **Admin-controlled system** with user self-service request forms
- **Minimal data retention** - archive immediately except property transfer dates
- **Strong automation preference** but manual admin approval required
- **User dashboard forms** for move-out/sale requests
- **No automatic status triggers** - all changes require admin action

---

## üîÑ STATUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### **Status Definitions & Triggers:**

#### **`active`**
- **Triggers:** Admin approval of new registrations, admin reactivation
- **No automatic triggers**

#### **`inactive`** 
- **Triggers:** Admin action after user move-out/sale request
- **Sub-categories to track:** Moved out, Sold property, Deceased, Banned, Other
- **Data retention:** Archive immediately (delete all data)

#### **`transferred`**
- **Triggers:** Admin action for internal estate moves/role changes
- **Data retention:** Keep property transfer dates only

#### **`pending_transfer`**
- **Triggers:** Admin sets after receiving user form request
- **Access:** Full access maintained
- **Duration:** No auto-revert, admin controls cancellation/completion
- **Notice period:** 30 days typical

---

## üìä DATA RETENTION POLICY

### **Tenant Only:**
- **Retention:** **NONE** - Delete all data immediately upon move-out
- **Security:** Immediate access revocation

### **Owner Only:**
- **Retention:** **Property transfer dates only**
- **Purpose:** Track ownership history for each ERF
- **Contact info:** Keep for property history inquiries

### **Owner-Resident:**
- **Scenario A (keeps ownership):** Handle as Owner Only
- **Scenario B (sells property):** Handle as Tenant (delete all data)
- **Transfer emergency contacts:** From resident to owner record if staying

### **No Communication Needed:**

## üè† PROPERTY MANAGEMENT APPROACH

### **What We Track:**
- **Property transfer dates** from owner to owner
- **ERF numbers and basic address info**
- **Utility meter numbers** (water/electricity)
- **Current active user** per property

### **What We Don't Track:**
- **Title deed numbers** or legal documents
- **Emergency contact transitions**
- **Vehicle ownership transfers** (vehicles belong to people, not properties)
- **Extended historical data**

---

## üîê ACCESS CONTROL PHILOSOPHY

### **During Pending Transfer:**
- **Full access maintained** until admin completes transition
- **New registrations allowed** with approval
- **No automatic access changes**

### **Upon Status Change:**
- **Admin controls all access changes**
- **No grace periods** - immediate when admin processes
- **Vehicle registrations handled like other profile updates**

---

## üéØ KEY SUCCESS METRICS

### **Frequency Expectations:**
- **~20 transitions per year** across all types
- **Most common:** Scenarios 1-4 (never property subdivision)

### **Automation Goals:**
- **User-initiated requests** via dashboard forms
- **Admin approval workflows** for all status changes
- **Bulk operation capabilities** for efficiency
- **Reporting on transition patterns**
