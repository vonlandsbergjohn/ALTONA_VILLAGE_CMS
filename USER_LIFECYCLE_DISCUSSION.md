# Altona Village CMS - User Lifecycle Management Discussion Document

**Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Topic:** User Invitation, Creation, and Transition Management System  
**Purpose:** Planning comprehensive user lifecycle management for property transitions

---

## üèòÔ∏è UNDERSTANDING THE USER LIFECYCLE SCENARIOS

### Common Transitions in Estate Management:

1. **Tenant moves out ‚Üí New tenant moves in** (same ERF)
2. **Owner sells ‚Üí New owner buys** (property ownership transfer)
3. **Owner becomes owner-resident** (moves into their own property)
4. **Owner-resident becomes just owner** (moves out, keeps ownership)
5. **Property gets subdivided/consolidated** (ERF changes)

**YOUR INPUT NEEDED:**
- Which of these scenarios are most common in your estate?
- Are there other transition scenarios we should consider?
- How frequently do these transitions occur?

---

## üí° SUGGESTED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 1. User Status Management
Instead of deleting users, use status-based approach:
- `active` - Currently using the property
- `inactive` - No longer using the property but data preserved
- `transferred` - Moved to another property/role
- `pending_transfer` - In process of transition

**YOUR INPUT NEEDED:**
- Do these status categories cover all scenarios?
- Should we add additional status types?
- How long should users remain in each status? (See detailed breakdown below for each user group)

### 2. Property-User Relationship Tracking
- **Current User** (active relationship)
- **Historical Users** (maintain audit trail)
- **Effective dates** (from/to dates for each relationship)

**YOUR INPUT NEEDED:**
- Is this relationship structure sufficient?
- Do you need to track multiple relationships simultaneously?
- What date information is most important for your records?

### 3. Invitation & Transfer System
```
Admin Dashboard Features:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Invite New User (email invitation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transfer Property (from old ‚Üí new user)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deactivate User (preserve data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reactivate User (if they return)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Merge User Data (combine accounts if needed)
```

**YOUR INPUT NEEDED:**
- What other admin features would be helpful?
- Should there be bulk operation capabilities?
- Do you need reporting features for transitions?

---

## üîÑ PROPOSED WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

### Scenario: Tenant Moving Out, New Tenant Moving In

1. **Admin receives notice** ‚Üí Clicks "Transfer Property"
2. **System creates invitation** ‚Üí Sends email to new tenant
3. **New tenant registers** ‚Üí System links them to ERF
4. **Admin confirms transfer** ‚Üí Old tenant becomes `inactive`, new tenant becomes `active`
5. **Data preservation** ‚Üí Old tenant's history preserved, vehicles/access transferred

**YOUR INPUT NEEDED:**
- Is this workflow realistic for your office procedures?
- What steps are missing or unnecessary?
- How much automation vs manual control do you prefer?

## üè† USER GROUP STATUS MANAGEMENT - DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### **TENANT ONLY** - Data Management When They Move Out

**Scenario:** Tenant moves out of ERF 123

**Status Transition:** `active` ‚Üí `inactive`

**Data Management Questions:**
- How long should tenant data remain in `inactive` status before archiving/deletion?
- Should we keep their vehicle registrations for reference?
- What about their emergency contact information?
- How long should we preserve their intercom code history?

**Considerations:**
- Tenants have **no ownership stake** - once they leave, relationship is severed
- May need data for **deposit returns, damage claims, reference checks**
- **Security concern:** Old intercom codes should be deactivated quickly
- **Vehicle access:** Should be removed immediately for security

**YOUR INPUT FOR TENANT DATA RETENTION:**
[Please specify how long to keep inactive tenant data and what information to preserve/delete]

---

### **OWNER ONLY** - Data Management When They Sell Property

**Scenario:** Owner sells ERF 456 to new owner

**Status Transition:** `active` ‚Üí `transferred` (if staying in estate) OR `inactive` (if leaving estate)

**Data Management Questions:**
- How long should former owner data remain accessible for property transfer records?
- Should we keep their contact information for warranty/property history inquiries?
- What about their emergency contacts and family information?
- How do we handle their title deed numbers and legal documents?

**Considerations:**
- Owners have **legal/financial history** with the property
- New owners may need **contact information for property-related questions**
- **Legal documents:** May need to be preserved for longer periods
- **Financial records:** May be needed for tax, insurance, or legal purposes

**YOUR INPUT FOR OWNER DATA RETENTION:**
[Please specify how long to keep former owner data and what information must be preserved for legal/property reasons]

---

### **OWNER-RESIDENT** - Two Different Scenarios

#### **Scenario A: Owner-Resident moves out but KEEPS property (becomes Owner Only)**

**Status Transition:** 
- **Resident record:** `active` ‚Üí `inactive` 
- **Owner record:** Remains `active`

**Data Management Questions:**
- How long should the inactive resident data be kept?
- Should emergency contacts transfer from resident record to owner record?
- What about daily access needs (intercom, gate access) - should these be modified?
- Should vehicle registrations be updated to reflect non-resident status?

**Considerations:**
- Still has **ownership rights and responsibilities**
- May need **different access levels** (owner access vs resident access)
- **Emergency contacts:** May change since they don't live there anymore
- **Communication preferences:** May want property updates but not daily resident info

#### **Scenario B: Owner-Resident sells property (loses both roles)**

**Status Transition:** 
- **Both resident and owner records:** `active` ‚Üí `transferred` OR `inactive`

**Data Management Questions:**
- How long should both records be preserved?
- Should we maintain the link between their resident and owner histories?
- What information needs to be available for the new owner-resident?
- How do we handle the complete relationship termination?

**Considerations:**
- **Most complex transition** - losing both ownership and residency
- **Property history:** New owners may need their contact info for questions
- **Legal requirements:** May need to preserve records for longer due to ownership component
- **Complete access termination:** All systems (resident AND owner) need updating

**YOUR INPUT FOR OWNER-RESIDENT DATA RETENTION:**
[Please specify different retention periods and policies for Scenario A (keeps ownership) vs Scenario B (sells property)]

## ‚ùì KEY DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

### 1. Data Retention Policy by User Group
**Question:** How long should we keep user data for each group after they become inactive?

**User Group Specific Considerations:**

**TENANT ONLY:**
- Typical retention: 6 months to 2 years
- Reasons: Deposit disputes, reference checks, damage claims
- Security: Immediate access revocation needed

**OWNER ONLY:**
- Typical retention: 5-10 years or indefinitely
- Reasons: Property history, legal documents, warranty issues
- Legal: May have statutory requirements for financial records

**OWNER-RESIDENT:**
- Scenario A (keeps ownership): Resident data 2-3 years, Owner data indefinitely
- Scenario B (sells property): Combined records 5-10 years
- Complexity: Need to maintain relationship between both roles

**YOUR ANSWER:**
[Please specify retention periods for each user group and explain your reasoning]

### 2. Vehicle Transfer Management
**Question:** Should vehicles automatically transfer to new users?

**Considerations:**
- Vehicles might belong to the person, not the property
