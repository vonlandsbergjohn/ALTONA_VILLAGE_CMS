## System Architecture

### Overview

The Altona Village Community Management System is built using a modern full-stack architecture that separates concerns between the frontend presentation layer, backend API layer, and data persistence layer. This separation ensures maintainability, scalability, and security while providing a responsive user experience across different devices and platforms.

The system follows a RESTful API design pattern, with the backend serving as a stateless API server that handles all business logic, data validation, and database operations. The frontend is implemented as a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with the backend through HTTP requests, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.

### Technology Stack

- **Git**: Version control system
- **Render**: Cloud platform for deployment (recommended)
- **GitHub**: Source code repository and CI/CD integration

### System Components

The system architecture consists of several key components that work together to provide comprehensive community management functionality:

**Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, password management, and session management using JWT tokens. This service ensures secure access to the system while maintaining user sessions across different devices and browser sessions.

**User Management Service**: Manages resident profiles, account status, and role-based permissions. This service handles the approval process for new residents and maintains the relationship between users and their properties within the community.

**Property Management Service**: Maintains information about community properties, including ownership records, utility connections, and property associations. This service provides the foundation for linking residents to their homes and managing community assets.

**Vehicle Management Service**: Handles vehicle registration, gate access control, and visitor management. This service integrates with security systems to provide automated access control while maintaining comprehensive records for security and administrative purposes.

**Communication Service**: Manages email, SMS, and in-system messaging capabilities. This service provides the infrastructure for community-wide communications, targeted messaging, and automated notifications based on system events.

**Complaint Management Service**: Processes service requests, tracks resolution progress, and manages communication between residents and estate management. This service includes workflow management and reporting capabilities to ensure efficient issue resolution.

### Data Flow Architecture

The system implements a clear data flow pattern that ensures consistency and reliability across all operations:

**Request Processing**: All client requests are received by the Flask application server, which performs initial validation, authentication checks, and routing to appropriate service handlers.

**Business Logic Layer**: Service handlers implement business rules, perform data validation, and coordinate between different system components. This layer ensures that all operations comply with community policies and system requirements.

**Data Access Layer**: SQLAlchemy ORM handles all database operations, providing abstraction from specific database implementations and ensuring data consistency through transaction management.

**Response Generation**: API responses are formatted consistently across all endpoints, providing clear success indicators, error messages, and relevant data payloads for client consumption.

**Client State Management**: The React frontend maintains local state for user interface elements while synchronizing with backend data through API calls. This approach provides responsive user interactions while ensuring data consistency.

## Backend API Documentation

### Flask Application Structure

The Flask backend is organized using a modular blueprint structure that separates different functional areas into distinct modules. This organization promotes code maintainability and allows for independent development and testing of different system components.

**Application Factory Pattern**: The main application is created using the factory pattern, allowing for different configurations for development, testing, and production environments. This pattern also facilitates testing by allowing the creation of application instances with specific configurations.

**Blueprint Organization**: Each major functional area is implemented as a Flask blueprint, providing namespace isolation and modular organization. The current blueprint structure includes:

- **Authentication Blueprint** (`/api/auth`): Handles user registration, login, logout, and password management
- **User Blueprint** (`/api`): Manages user profiles and basic account operations
- **Admin Blueprint** (`/api/admin`): Provides administrative functions for estate management
- **Resident Blueprint** (`/api/resident`): Implements resident-specific functionality
- **Communication Blueprint** (`/api/communication`): Handles messaging and notification features

**Middleware and Extensions**: The application includes several middleware components and extensions that provide cross-cutting functionality:

- **CORS Support**: Enables cross-origin requests from the frontend application
- **JWT Authentication**: Provides stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Request Validation**: Ensures that incoming requests contain valid data and proper formatting
- **Error Handling**: Provides consistent error responses and logging for debugging

### Database Models and Relationships

The database schema is implemented using SQLAlchemy ORM, providing a clear object-oriented interface to the underlying relational database. The model structure reflects the real-world relationships within a residential community while maintaining data integrity and supporting efficient queries.

**User Model**: The central user model represents all system users, including residents and administrators. This model includes authentication credentials, basic profile information, and role assignments. The user model serves as the foundation for all other relationships within the system.

**Resident Model**: Extends user information with resident-specific data including emergency contacts, property associations, and community preferences. This model maintains the detailed information necessary for community management while linking to the broader user authentication system.

**Property Model**: Represents individual properties within the community, including ownership information, utility connections, and physical characteristics. This model supports complex ownership arrangements and provides the foundation for property-based communications and services.

**Vehicle Model**: Manages vehicle registrations and gate access permissions. This model includes vehicle identification information, ownership relationships, and access control settings. The model supports both permanent and temporary vehicle registrations.

**Complaint Model**: Tracks service requests and complaints from residents, including status information, assignment details, and resolution history. This model provides the foundation for the complaint management workflow and reporting capabilities.

**Communication Models**: Support various communication features including message templates, delivery tracking, and recipient management. These models enable targeted communications and provide audit trails for all messaging activities.

### API Authentication and Security

The authentication system implements industry-standard security practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication, allowing for scalable session management without server-side session storage.

**Registration Process**: New user registration includes email verification and administrative approval to ensure that only legitimate community members gain access to the system. The registration process validates user information and creates pending accounts that require approval before activation.

**Login and Token Management**: User authentication generates JWT tokens that include user identity and role information. These tokens are signed using a secret key and include expiration times to limit the impact of potential token compromise. The system supports token refresh to maintain user sessions without requiring frequent re-authentication.

**Role-Based Access Control**: The system implements role-based permissions that control access to different features and data based on user roles. Administrators have access to management functions, while residents can only access their own information and community features.

**Password Security**: User passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms before storage, ensuring that plain-text passwords are never stored in the database. The system includes password strength requirements and supports secure password reset procedures.

**API Endpoint Protection**: All sensitive API endpoints require valid JWT tokens and appropriate role permissions. The system validates tokens on each request and provides clear error messages for authentication failures.

### Error Handling and Logging

Comprehensive error handling ensures that the system provides meaningful feedback to users while maintaining security and system stability. The error handling system distinguishes between different types of errors and provides appropriate responses for each situation.

**Validation Errors**: Input validation errors provide specific feedback about data format requirements and missing information. These errors help users correct their input without exposing sensitive system information.

**Authentication Errors**: Authentication failures provide clear but generic error messages to prevent information disclosure about valid user accounts. The system logs authentication attempts for security monitoring.

**Authorization Errors**: Access control violations result in clear error messages that inform users about permission requirements without revealing system structure or sensitive information.

**System Errors**: Internal system errors are logged for administrative review while providing generic error messages to users. This approach maintains system security while enabling effective troubleshooting.

**Logging Infrastructure**: The system implements comprehensive logging that captures user activities, system events, and error conditions. Log entries include timestamps, user identification, and relevant context information for security monitoring and troubleshooting.
