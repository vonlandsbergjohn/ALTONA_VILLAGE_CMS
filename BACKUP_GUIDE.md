# ALTONA VILLAGE CMS - COMPLETE BACKUP GUIDE

## 🚨 Why Your Database Wasn't Backed Up

Your GitHub backups don't include the database because:

1. **`.gitignore` excludes `*.db` files** - This is correct for security!
2. **Databases are binary files** - Git isn't designed for frequently changing binary data
3. **Contains sensitive data** - Resident information shouldn't be in public repositories
4. **Large file issues** - Database files can become very large over time

## 🛡️ Complete Backup Solution

I've created a comprehensive backup system that includes **EVERYTHING**:

### What Gets Backed Up
- ✅ **Complete Database** (SQLite file + SQL dump + JSON export)
- ✅ **All Source Code** (Python backend, React frontend)
- ✅ **Configuration Files** (requirements, package.json, etc.)
- ✅ **Environment Information** (Python packages, versions)
- ✅ **Restoration Instructions** (step-by-step guide)

### Backup Formats Created
1. **SQLite Database File** - Direct copy of `app.db`
2. **SQL Dump** - Universal SQL format for any database system
3. **JSON Export** - Human-readable data export
4. **ZIP Archive** - Complete compressed backup

## 🔧 How to Use the Backup System

### Option 1: Quick Backup (Easiest)
```bash
# Double-click this file:
quick_backup.bat

# Or run from command line:
python complete_backup_system.py
```

### Option 2: Custom Backup
```python
from complete_backup_system import AltonaVillageBackupSystem

backup_system = AltonaVillageBackupSystem()
result = backup_system.create_complete_backup("my_custom_backup_name")
```

### Option 3: Automated Scheduled Backups
Create a Windows Task Scheduler task to run `quick_backup.bat` daily/weekly.

## 🔄 Restoration Process

### Complete System Crash Recovery:

1. **Extract Backup ZIP** to new location
2. **Copy Database**: `database/app.db` → `altona_village_cms/src/database/app.db`
3. **Setup Python Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r configuration/requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Setup Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd altona-village-frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
5. **Start System**:
   ```bash
   python altona_village_cms/src/main.py
   ```

### Partial Recovery (Database Only):
```bash
# Replace corrupted database
copy "BACKUPS\[backup_name]\database\app.db" "altona_village_cms\src\database\app.db"

# Or restore from SQL dump
sqlite3 altona_village_cms/src/database/app.db < BACKUPS/[backup_name]/database/database_dump.sql
```

## 📅 Recommended Backup Schedule

### For Active Development:
- **Daily**: Before making major changes
- **Weekly**: Regular scheduled backup
- **Before Updates**: Always backup before system updates

### For Production:
- **Daily**: Automated backups
- **Weekly**: Manual verification backups
- **Monthly**: Long-term archive backups

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Storage Locations:
- **Local**: Keep recent backups on local drives
- **External**: Copy to external drives regularly
- **Cloud**: Encrypted cloud storage for offsite backups
- **Network**: Shared network drives for team access

### Security Measures:
- ⚠️ **Encrypt backups** containing resident data
- 🔐 **Limit access** to authorized personnel only
- 📝 **Document backup locations** securely
- 🗑️ **Safely delete** old backups when no longer needed

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Create backup now
python complete_backup_system.py

# List existing backups
python -c "from complete_backup_system import AltonaVillageBackupSystem; AltonaVillageBackupSystem().list_backups()"

# Quick backup (Windows)
quick_backup.bat
```

## 🆘 Emergency Recovery

If your system crashes and you have a backup:

1. **Don't Panic** - Your data is safe in the backup!
2. **Find Latest Backup** - Check `BACKUPS/` folder or ZIP files
3. **Follow Instructions** - Each backup includes `RESTORATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. **Test After Restore** - Verify all data is present and system works
5. **Resume Backups** - Set up regular backup schedule immediately

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Permission Errors**: Run as administrator
- **Path Issues**: Make sure you're in the project root directory
- **Missing Dependencies**: Check `configuration/setup_information.txt`
- **Database Locked**: Make sure the application isn't running

### Backup Verification:
```python
# Check backup integrity
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('BACKUPS/[backup_name]/database/app.db')
result = conn.execute('PRAGMA integrity_check').fetchone()
print('Database OK' if result[0] == 'ok' else 'Database Corrupted')
conn.close()
"
```
