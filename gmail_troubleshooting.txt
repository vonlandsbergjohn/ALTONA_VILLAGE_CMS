# Alternative Gmail Configuration
# If App Passwords don't work, try this approach

# 1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
# 2. Turn ON "2-Step Verification" 
# 3. Generate a new App Password specifically for "Mail"
# 4. Use the EXACT 16-character password (with spaces removed)

# Example format of App Password (yours will be different):
# Generated: abcd efgh ijkl mnop  
# Use in .env: abcdefghijklmnop (no spaces)

# If that still doesn't work, try:
# 1. Enable "Less secure app access" (temporary)
# 2. Use your regular Gmail password
# 3. This is less secure but works for testing

# Your current password length: 15 characters (should be 16)
# This suggests the App Password is incomplete
